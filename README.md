# 🏡 Housing Data Cleaning & Exploration (SQL)

## 🧠 Overview  
This project explores and prepares Nashville real estate data using advanced SQL queries. The goal was to transform unstructured housing data into clean, analysis-ready tables.

## ❓ Problem Statement  
The original dataset had inconsistencies, null values, and no pre-defined schema, making it unfit for business analysis.

## 🔍 Approach & Methodology  
- Connected and queried raw data using Snowflake  
- Used CTEs and window functions to calculate trends (e.g., average price per square foot)  
- Standardized inconsistent location and property type values  
- Built SQL views for easy reuse by BI tools

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
- SQL (Snowflake), CASE WHEN, Joins, CTEs, Aggregates

## 📈 Results  
- Created structured data tables with >95% completeness  
- Identified high-growth zip codes and pricing trends  
- Enabled integration with visualization platforms

## 💡 What I Learned  
- Advanced SQL logic for EDA  
- Structuring raw business data for long-term reuse  
- Importance of standardized naming conventions for analytics
